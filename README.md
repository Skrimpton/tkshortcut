Trivial Linux desktop entry creator in Tkinter

My first learning exercise in Tkinter, just a few text entry boxes and file pickers that output a Linux desktop entry in the form:

[Desktop Entry]
Name={name}
Exec={executable}
Icon={icon}

The code is completely unstructured and hardcoded, there is no error checking or handling, and the file picker doesn't generate thumbnails. This is the result of two hours of work after starting my first Tkinter tutorial. But it does what I want it to do.
